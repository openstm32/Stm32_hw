This design is a clone of Leaf Labs Maple Mini board (called MM4) 
	with the following variations from the original:

	- 0.8 inch pitch between connectors rather than 0.6". 
		This means dual rows of sip connectors are required 
		rather than a 40 pin dip (a socket layout can easily 
		be defined for either LeafLabs or MM4 using 3 sip 
		connectors.)

	- identical pin functions except for the above mentioned 
		pitch change.

	- two layer layout in Eagle which can be modified with the 
		free version of Eagle (original was done with 
		Eagle v6.1). Ground planes that are as large as 
		practical are used given the two layer constraint 
		(modification to internal power/ground planes is, 
		of course, fairly straightforward, but requires 
		the much more expensive Eagle license).

	- 64 pin processor that can be STM32F10xC/D/E orSTM32F4 
		or STM32L1 series. This means the F1 chip variants 
		with larger memories can be used or the L1 low power 
		series (F1 and L1 require two solder bridge jumpers 
		to be installed), or the faster Cortex-M4 F4 series.

	- considerably less detailed top silkscreen layer in this 
		version of MM4. 

	- Current status is UNTESTED.
